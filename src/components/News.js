				"old major the old boar on the manor farm calls the animals on the farm for a meeting where he compares the humans to parasites and teaches the animals a revolutionary song beasts of england when major dies two young pigs snowball and napoleon assume command and turn his dream into a philosophy the animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible mr jones from the farm renaming it animal farm they adopt seven commandments of animal ism the most important of which is all animals are equal snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health napoleon takes the pups from the farm dogs and trains them privately napoleon and snowball struggle for leadership when snowball announces his plans to build a windmill napoleon has his dogs chase snowball away and declares himself leader napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm using a young pig named squealer as a mouthpiece napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill after a violent storm the animals find the windmill annihilated napoleon and squealer convince the animals that snowball destroyed it although the scorn of the neighbouring farmers suggests that its walls were too thin once snowball becomes a scapegoat napoleon begins purging the farm with his dogs killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival he and the pigs abuse their power imposing more control while reserving privileges for themselves and rewriting history villainising snowball and glorifying napoleon squealer justifies every statement napoleon makes even the pigs alteration of the seven commandments of animalism to benefit themselves beasts of england is replaced by an anthem glorifying napoleon who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man the animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were when under mr jones squealer abuses the animals poor memories and invents numbers to show their improvement mr frederick one of the neighbouring farmers attacks the farm using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill though the animals win the battle they do so at great cost as many including boxer the workhorse are wounded despite his injuries boxer continues working harder and harder until he collapses while working on the windmill napoleon sends for a van to take boxer to the veterinary surgeons explaining that better care can be given there benjamin the cynical donkey who could read as well as any pig notices that the van belongs to a knacker and attempts to mount a rescue but the animals attempts are futile squealer reports that the van was purchased by the hospital and the writing from the previous owner had not been repainted he recounts a tale of boxers death in the hands of the best medical care years pass and the pigs learn to walk upright carry whips and wear clothes the seven commandments are reduced to a single phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and the humans of the area who congratulate napoleon on having the hardest working but least fed animals in the country napoleon announces an alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both worlds he abolishes practices and traditions related to the revolution and changes the name of the farm to the manor farm the animals overhearing the conversation notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing during a poker match an argument breaks out between napoleon and mr pilkington and the animals realise that the faces of the pigs look like the faces of humans and no one can tell the difference between them the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old majors ideas into an actual philosophy which they formally name animalism soon after napoleon and squealer indulge in the vices of humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history in order to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society the original commandments are whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend no animal shall wear clothes no animal shall sleep in a bed no animal shall drink alcohol no animal shall kill any other animal all animals are equal later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear them of accusations of law breaking such as no animal shall drink alcohol having to excess appended to it and no animal shall sleep in a bed with with sheets added to it the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets no animal shall drink alcohol to excess no animal shall kill any other animal without cause eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and prevent animals from following the humans evil habits through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda",

situation a special ward is opened at the hospital but its beds are filled within three days as the death toll begins to rise more desperate measures are taken homes are quarantined corpses and burials are strictly supervised a supply of plague serum finally arrives but there is only enough to treat existing cases and the countrys emergency reserves are depleted when the daily number of

join his lover in paris after city officials refuse his request to leave he befriends some criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city another character father paneloux uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of god punishing the citizens sinful nature his diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances cottard a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide yet fearful of being arrested becomes wealthy as a major smuggler meanwhile dr rieux a vacationer jean tarrou and a civil servant joseph grand exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital rambert informs tarrou of his escape plan but when

join tarrou and dr rieux to help fight the epidemic in mid august the situation continues to worsen people try to escape the town but some are shot by armed sentries violence and looting break out on a small scale and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew funerals are conducted with more and more speed no ceremony and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased the inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation despondent they waste away emotionally as well as physically in september and october the town remains at the mercy of the plague rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wifes condition is worsening he also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work

glucks opera orpheus and eurydice but the actor portraying orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance rambert finally has a chance to escape but he decides to stay saying that he

has a run in with traders from toledo who insult the imaginary dulcinea one of whom severely beats don quixote and leaves him on the side of the road don quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant the second sally while don quixote is unconscious in his bed his niece the housekeeper the parish curate and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off after a short period of feigning health don quixote approaches his neighbor sancho panza and asks him to be his squire promising him governorship of an island the uneducated sancho agrees and the pair sneak off in the early dawn it is here that their series of famous adventures begin starting with don quixotes attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants the two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage they are heavily cloaked as is the lady to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road don quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive he knocks a friar from his horse and is immediately challenged by an armed basque traveling with the company as he has no shield the basque uses a pillow to protect himself which saves him when don quixote strikes him the combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and demanding those traveling with her to surrender to don quixote the pastoral wanderings sancho and don quixote go on and fall in with a group of goatherds don quixote tells sancho and the goatherds about the golden age of man reminiscent of both ovid and the later rousseau in which property does not exist and men live in peace the goatherds invite the knight and sancho to the funeral of gris stomo once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels seeking the shepherdess marcela at the funeral marcela appears delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by gris stomo claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clich s she disappears into the woods and don quixote and sancho follow ultimately giving up the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest some galicians arrive to water their ponies and rocinante don quixotes horse attempts to mate with the ponies the galicians hit rocinante with clubs to dissuade him which don quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend rocinante the galicians beat don quixote and sancho leaving them in great pain the adventures with cardenio and dorotea after don quixote frees a group of galley slaves the knight and sancho wander into the sierra morena and there encounter the dejected cardenio cardenio relates the first part of his story in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend luscinda and is hired as the companion to the dukes son leading to his friendship with the dukes younger son don fernando cardenio confides in don fernando his love for luscinda and the delays in their engagement caused by cardenios desire to keep with tradition after reading cardenios poems praising luscinda don fernando falls in love with her don quixote interrupts when cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels in the course of their travels the protagonists meet innkeepers prostitutes goatherds soldiers priests escaped convicts and scorned lovers these encounters are magnified by don quixote s imagination into chivalrous quests don quixote s tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him and his habit of not paying his debts result in many privations injuries and humiliations with sancho often getting the worst of it finally don quixote is persuaded to return to his home village the author hints that there was a third quest but says that records of it have been lost the third sally although the two parts are now normally published as a single work don quixote part two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel while part one was mostly farcical the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception as part two begins it is assumed that the literate classes of spain have all read the first part of the history of don quixote and his squire cervantess meta fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of part one as well as with an actually published fraudulent part two when strangers encounter the duo in person they already know their famous history a duke and duchess and others deceive don quixote for entertainment setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes some of them are quite sadistic and they put don quixotes sense of chivalry and his devotion to dulcinea through many tests even sancho deceives him at one point pressured into finding dulcinea sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls and tells don quixote that they are dulcinea and her ladies in waiting when don quixote only sees the peasant girls sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when as part of one of the duke and duchesss pranks the two are led to believe that the only method to release dulcinea from her spell is for sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes sancho naturally resists this course of action leading to friction with his master under the dukes patronage sancho eventually gets a governorship though it is false and proves to be a wise and practical ruler though this ends in humiliation as well near the end don quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity an inn is just an inn not a castle the lengthy untold history of don quixotes adventures in knight errantry comes to a close after his battle with the knight of the white moon in which we the readers find him conquered bound by the rules of chivalry don quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror which in this case is that don quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year a duration in which he may be cured of his madness defeated and dejected he and sancho start their journey home part two of don quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about this is a theme much explored in writings of the th century upon returning to his village don quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd although his housekeeper who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs soon after he retires to his bed with a deathly illness possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations one day he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity sancho tries to restore his faith but alonso quixano for that is his true name can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused he dictates his will which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry after alonso quixano dies the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate and that any further books about don quixote would be spurious",

				"twelve years after the events described in dune paul muaddib atreides rules as emperor by accepting the role of messiah to the fremen paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known universe while paul is the most powerful emperor ever known he is powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he has created although sixty one billion people have perished pauls prescient visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity motivated by this knowledge paul hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of the fremen religion the bene gesserit spacing guild and tleilaxu enter into a conspiracy to dethrone paul the bene gesserit reverend mother gaius helen mohiam enlisting pauls own consort princess irulan daughter of the deposed padishah emperor shaddam corrino iv paul has refused to father a child with irulan or even touch her but his fremen concubine chani has also failed to produce an heir causing tension within his monarchy desperate both to secure her place in the atreides dynasty and to preserve the atreides bloodline for the bene gesserit breeding program irulan has secretly been giving contraceptives to chani paul is aware of this fact but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring chanis death and does not want to lose her because of the way oracles interfere with one anothers prescience the guild navigator edric is able to shield the conspiracy from pauls visions of the future the tleilaxu face dancer scytale gives paul a gift he cannot resist a tleilaxu grown ghola of the deceased duncan idaho pauls childhood teacher and friend now called hayt the conspirators hope the presence of hayt will undermine pauls ability to rule by forcing paul to question himself and the empire he has created furthermore pauls acceptance of the gift weakens his support among the fremen who see the tleilaxu and their tools as unclean chani taking matters into her own hands switches to a traditional fremen fertility diet preventing irulan from being able to tamper with her food and soon becomes pregnant otheym one of pauls former fedaykin death commandos reveals evidence of a fremen conspiracy against paul otheym gives paul his dwarf tleilaxu servant bijaz who like a recording machine can remember faces names and details paul accepts reluctantly seeing the strands of a tleilaxu plot as pauls soldiers attack the conspirators others set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner purchased from the tleilaxu that destroys the area and blinds paul by tradition all blind fremen are abandoned in the desert but paul shocks the fremen and entrenches his godhead by proving he can still see even without eyes his oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee in his mind everything that happens as though his eyes still function by moving through his life in lockstep with his visions he can see even the slightest details of the world around him the disadvantage of this is his inability to change any part of his destiny so long as he wishes to appear sighted the unraveling of the fremen conspiracy reveals that korba a former fedaykin and now high priest of pauls church is among pauls enemies hayt interrogates bijaz but the little man actually an agent of the tleilaxu uses a specific humming intonation that renders hayt open to implanted commands bijaz programs hayt to offer paul a bargain when chani dies chanis rebirth as a ghola and the hope that duncan idahos memories might be reawakened in return for paul sacrificing the throne and going into exile bijaz also implants a compulsion that will force hayt to attempt to kill paul given the appropriate circumstances hayt remains oblivious of the programming eventually news is brought that chani has died giving birth pauls reaction to it triggers the compulsions in the mind of hayt who attempts to kill paul but rather than kill his beloved paul duncans ghola body reacts against its own programming and recovers duncans full consciousness he remains conscious of the zen sunni and mentat training given to hayt by the tleilaxu but is no longer bound to their programming paul and chanis newborn twins are pre born like pauls sister alia had been and come into the world fully conscious with kwisatz haderach like access to ancestral memories thanks to a combination of their genes and an in utero exposure to the quantities of spice in chanis special pregnancy diet scytale offers to revive chani as a ghola in return for all of pauls choam holdings paul refuses to submit to the possibility that the tleilaxu might program chani in some diabolical way and scytale threatens the infants with a knife while he negotiates with alia paul has now been rendered completely blind by the presence of his oracular son yet he is able to kill scytale with an accurately aimed dagger thanks to a vision from his sons perspective now prophetically as well as physically blind paul chooses to embrace the fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone into the desert winning the fealty of the fremen for his children who will inherit his mantle of emperor paul leaves alia now romantically involved with duncan as regent for the twins whom he has named leto and ghanima duncan notes the irony that paul and chanis deaths had enabled them to triumph against their enemies and that paul has escaped deification by walking into the desert as a man while guaranteeing fremen support for the atreides line",
